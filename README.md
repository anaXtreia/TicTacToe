# AnaX's Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic game of Tic Tac Toe using Python and the Pygame library. The game is designed for two players to play on the same device.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation
1. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install Pygame by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
3. Clone this repository or download the zip file.
4. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo or downloaded the zip and extract it.
5. Run the `tictactoe.py` file.

## How to Play
* The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
* Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O.
* Players take turns placing their symbol on the grid.
* The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
* If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.

## Player vs Machine
In the `user-vs-machine` branch you will find another version of the game, where the user plays against the machine.
This was developed using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta-pruning.
